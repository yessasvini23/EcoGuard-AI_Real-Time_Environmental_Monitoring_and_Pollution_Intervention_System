# 🌍 EcoGuard AI: Real-Time Pollution Monitoring & Intervention System

> “Turning passive data into life-saving action”  
> 🧠 Powered by AI | 🛰️ IoT & Drones | ⛓️ Blockchain | 🌱 Built for the Planet

---

## 📌 Overview

**EcoGuard AI** is an open-source, AI-driven environmental protection system that detects and neutralizes pollution *in real time*. Unlike passive monitoring tools, EcoGuard acts — predicting pollution spikes and deploying autonomous drones to clean air and water before lives are affected.

🎯 Targeted at **urban air and water pollution**, which causes:
- 🧬 ~7 million premature deaths/year (WHO)
- 💸 $5 trillion in global welfare losses (World Bank)

---

## 🚨 Problem

Most environmental systems today only *monitor*. By the time pollution alerts are raised, the damage is often done.  
**EcoGuard AI flips the model: Predict. Respond. Protect.**

## 🧪 MVP: Get Started

You can build a basic prototype using:
```bash
📡 Raspberry Pi + MQ135 (Air) + TDS/pH (Water)
🧠 AI: Use Jupyter Notebooks in `/notebooks/` to forecast pollution
🚁 Drone: Simulate missions using PX4 SITL in `/drones/`


🎯 Use Cases
🚨 Emergency pollution alert + drone response

🏭 Corporate emissions tracking for ESG compliance

📲 Citizen reporting through mobile AR + eco-token incentives

🌍 Municipal dashboard for real-time air & water quality
