# 🌍 EcoGuard AI – Real-Time Pollution Detection & Intervention System

EcoGuard AI is an award-winning environmental tech solution that combines **AI, IoT, drones, blockchain, and AR** to fight pollution **in real time**. More than just monitoring, it acts — sending autonomous drones to neutralize threats like oil spills or toxic air zones **before** they harm public health.

## 💡 Key Features
- **AI Forecasting**: Predicts air & water pollution spikes 12–24 hrs in advance
- **IoT Sensors**: Low-cost, solar-powered Raspberry Pi sensors for PM2.5, CO2, pH, heavy metals
- **Drone Swarms**: Biodegradable nanocellulose-based cleanup missions
- **Blockchain**: Verifiable emissions data, corporate compliance tracking (Polygon-based)
- **AR Mobile App**: Citizens scan areas to report issues & earn eco-tokens
- **Edge + 5G**: Real-time responses with ultra-low latency

## 🚀 MVP Stack (Open Source)
- 🧠 AI: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (trained on NASA/EPA open datasets)
- 🔧 IoT: Raspberry Pi + MQ135 + DHT11 + TDS sensors
- 🛸 Drone: PX4 Autopilot + OpenCV + GPS Waypoints
