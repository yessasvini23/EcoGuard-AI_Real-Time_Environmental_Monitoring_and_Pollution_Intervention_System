# 🌍 EcoGuard AI: Real-Time Pollution Monitoring & Intervention System  
**“Turning passive data into life-saving action”**  
🧠 AI-Powered | 🛰️ IoT & Drones | ⛓️ Blockchain Transparency | 🌱 Built for the Planet

---

## 📌 Overview  
**EcoGuard AI** is an open-source, real-time environmental protection system that doesn’t just monitor — it acts.  
By combining **AI predictions**, **IoT sensors**, **autonomous drones**, and **blockchain logging**, EcoGuard detects pollution *before* it spikes and responds instantly to protect both ecosystems and human lives.

🔁 Unlike traditional tools that passively monitor, EcoGuard AI’s mission is:  
**Predict → Respond → Protect**

---

## 🚨 The Problem  
- 🧬 ~7 million premature deaths/year from pollution (WHO)  
- 💸 $5 trillion in global welfare losses (World Bank)  

Most systems today raise alerts only after damage is done.  
**EcoGuard AI flips the model** — from reaction to *prevention*.
